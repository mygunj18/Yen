# YenAlgo
Implementation in Python3 for computing Kth shortest path algorithm from a source to a destination in a weighted graph. Source and destination has to be entered by user. This source and destination should be part of input file which we will be reading into our code. We will be reading csv file as input.Csv file will be having details of nodes with edges and corresponding weights.
